BUGS:
    CRITICAL:
        "breaks app"
        - error when moving slider in minimum rect size scale widget causes too much recursion and app to crash. Only caused on minimum rect size scale, not motion sensitivity
    URGENT:
        "component(s) functionality failing"
        - minimum rect size menu in menubar not moving scale when size selected
        - minimum custom rect size menu "custom" selection does nothing, needs implementing to new CustomInputWindow class (ttk_styles.py)
    IMPORTANT:
        "doesn't break anything, but is wrong"
        - when camera is paused, motion updates are very slow and glitchy
    NICE TO FIX:
        "shouldn't really be like that"
        - correct motion detection amount of detections listed on resize window to fit frame
