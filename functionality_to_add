# Done
    Cycle thru cameras
    Pre-recorded video motion detection
    pause/play button
    flip image
    file menu

Change output video colour / style (eg greyscale, diff frame)
output a sound on motions (maybe when rect is > a size)
configure sound outputted
output to files for each day rather than 1 continuous file?

resize in aspect ratio so frame doesn't become distorted
correct motion detection amount of detections listed on resize window

# Auto Resize ->
    The auto resize of the image is currently done by getting the size of the label that it is contained in. 
    This label size changes when the window resizes due to grid_columnconfigure(). This causes issue as the 
    label takes time to resize on startup and window resize. Maybe the first frame could be accessed and its
    frame size extracted before window shows so window can be sized accurately before appearing to stop with
    the visible resizing on startup.

# Sound playback ->
    When playing the sound after motion is detected (commented out line in controller.py line 148), it causes
    a delay in checking motion while the audio is played back. This is once every 3 seconds on my machine. 
    Perhaps it could be implemented on another thread to stop this delay.
