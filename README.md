# MotionDetector

An application which detects motion from a video source and displays the times at which motion was recorded, aswell as drawing rectangles around moving objects in the video. Can accept video from pre recorded files or live webcam footage. Many settings can be modified such as sensitivity of the detector and minimum rectangle size for it to draw.

To run, simply run "main.py"

Tested on python 3.10, however may work in other python 3.x versions. Will not work in python 2
