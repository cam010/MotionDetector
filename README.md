# MotionDetector

To run - Start main.pyw

This software detects motion in either a pre-recorded video file or a live video feed from a camera connected / built in to the computer. The program can also pause/play the video feed. It will draw rectangles around objects that are moving to clearly show motion. The motion timestamps will be recorded in app and also stored in a log file. There are various settings to alter the detection of motion and the video displayed such as motion sensitivity.
