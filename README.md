# MotionDetector

To run - Start main.pyw

This app uses the webcam to establish a near-live video feed. It detects differences between frames taken by the webcam to detect motion. The detected changes are then
drawn around with a rectangle. The rectangles can be toggled and have their size changed. The sensitivity of the motion detection can also be modified.
The program lists the previous 12 motions detected which updates every 3 seconds. The motions are detected and stored internally every 0.25 seconds. The images are never 
stored or uploaded
